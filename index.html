    <h2 class="category-headers">About Me</h2>
      <p class="category-description-main">I help social impact organizations deliver product value and drive growth. I contribute to teams by using data-informed marketing, product design, user research, and front-end code.</p>

      <p class="category-description-main">Today, I lead product marketing at <a target="_blank" href="http://panoramaed.com">Panorama Education</a>, a Y-Combinator and Google Ventures-backed company that is using data analytics to improve student outcomes in K-12 public school districts nationwide. Previously, I created <a target="_blank" href="http://speech4good.com">Speech4Good</a> to help people (like me) with speech disorders access proven therapy tools through mobile apps. Before that, I studied political science and won a national championship in <a href="http://uslaxmagazine.com/college_men/DIII/2013-14/news/030314_making_sense_tufts_fearless_problem_solver" target="_blank">lacrosse</a> at Tufts University.</p>

        <p class="category-details">Founder, 2011-2013</p>
        <p class="category-description">After undergoing speech therapy myself for over twelve years, I decided to create technology tools to serve others with speech disorders. I developed the product strategy, prototypes of minimum viable products, and a distribution strategy for the suite of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/speech4good-stuttering-speech/id467558411?mt=8" target="_blank">iOS apps</a> as a full-time college student.
