      <h2 class="category-headers" id="about">About</h2>
        <p class="category-description-main">I help mission-driven technology companies grow their customer base and build products that people love. I contribute to teams by using data-informed product, growth, and go-to market strategies, and (occasionally) front-end code.</p>

        <p class="category-description-main">Today, I'm studying at the <a target="_blank" href="https://darden.virginia.edu">University of Virginia Darden School of Business</a> as a candidate pursuing a dual-MBA/M.Ed degree. Previously, I led product marketing at <a target="_blank" href="https://panoramaed.com">Panorama Education</a> (YC'13), a company that's helping to improve student outcomes in K-12 schools through social-emotional learning assessment and analytics.</p>

        <p class="category-description-main">Before that, I created <a target="_blank" href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/speech4good">Speech4Good</a> to help people (like me) with speech disorders access proven therapy tools through mobile apps. And before that, I studied political science and won a national championship with the lacrosse team at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tufts.edu/">Tufts University</a>.</p>
