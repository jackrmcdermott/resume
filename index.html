    <h2 class="category-headers" id="about">About</h2>
      <p class="category-description-main">I help mission-driven technology organizations attain growth and build products that people love. I contribute to teams by using data-informed demand generation and growth marketing, product design, go-to market strategy, and (occasionally) front-end code.</p>

      <p class="category-description-main">Today, I lead product marketing at <a target="_blank" href="http://panoramaed.com">Panorama Education</a>, a company that's using data analytics to improve student outcomes in hundreds of school districts nationwide. Previously, I created <a target="_blank" href="http://speech4good.com">Speech4Good</a> to help people (like me) with speech disorders access proven therapy tools through mobile apps. Before that, I studied political science and won a national championship in lacrosse with my team at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tufts.edu/">Tufts University</a>.</p>
